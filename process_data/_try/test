'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] encompassing [[anarchist schools of thought|theories and attitudes]] which consider the [[Sovereign state|state]], as compulsory [[government]], to be unnecessary, harmful, and/or undesirable, and promote the [[stateless society|elimination of the state]] or [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;*[[Errico Malatesta]], &quot;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/malatesta/1930s/xx/toanarchy.htm Towards Anarchism]&quot;, ''MAN!''.

Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific anarchists may have additional criteria for what constitutes anarchism, and they often disagree with each other on what these criteria are. According to ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', &quot;there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain [[family resemblance]].&quot;&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=2002 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.B.

AK Press, 2002, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; Some anarchists fundamentally oppose all forms of [[coercion]], while others have supported the use of some coercive measures, including violent revolution and terrorism, on the path to [[anarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R.B. &quot;The Anarchist Tradition of Political Thought.&quot; ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 25, No. 4.

The term ''anarchism'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]. [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]], &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]], &quot;[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237439]&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix ἀν- (''an-'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἄρχή (''archê'', &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liddell |first=Henry George |coauthors=Scott, Robert |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315894}}&lt;/ref&gt; + -ισμός (''-ismos'', from a [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] -ιζειν, ''-izein''). There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms &quot;[[Libertarianism (disambiguation)|libertarianism]]&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; in writings about anarchism. Since the 1890s from France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0900384891 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean. [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], &quot;Ideas on Liberty,&quot; May, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; its use as a synonym is still common outside the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin.

*Note: the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has [[Libertarianism (disambiguation)|other meanings]] as well.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, &quot;[[libertarian socialism]]&quot; (a term that also includes non-anarchist philosophies) is sometimes used as a synonym for [[socialist anarchism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perlin |first=Terry M. |title=Contemporary Anarchism |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=1979 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, Carlos Peregrín Otero.
